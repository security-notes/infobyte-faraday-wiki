What is Faraday

Faraday is the first multiuser Penetration test IDE. Designed for distribution, indexation and analysis of the generated data during the process of a security audit.

The main purpose of Faraday is to re-use the available tools in the community to take advantages of them in a multiuser way.

Background

Users should not feel any difference between their own terminal application and the one included in Faraday thanks to the simplicity within it, with a specialized set of functionalities that help users improve doing their work.  
Do you remember yourself programming without an IDE? Well, Faraday does the same an IDE does for you when programming, but from the perspective of a penetration test.
