# Intro

Tags allow you to organize your vulnerabilities by letting you make and edit categories: environment, technology, state, technology, language, projects, whatever. The team can then see the tagged vulnerabilities and lets you organize the security evaluation.

The tags are assigned to the team´s workspace letting you use different tags for different projects.

# How to tag vulnerabilities

Using the specified credentials during the configuration, from the Navigator start the session in  [Faraday´s GUI](https://github.com/tartamar/faraday/wiki/Web-UI). Once you have obtained the authentication and you are in, click on the “Status Report” ![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/tartamar/faraday/images/faraday_statusreport_icono.png)
