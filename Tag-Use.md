Tags allow you to organize your vulnerabilities. by letting you make and edit categories: environment, technology, state, language, projects, whatever. The team can then see the tagged vulnerabilities and lets you organize the security evaluation.

The tags are assigned to the team's workspace letting you use different tags for different projects.

Using the specified credentials during the configuration, from the Navigator start the session in [Faraday's GUI](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/Status-report). Once you have obtained the authentication and you are in, click on the “Status Report” icon.
