Migration Guide for the New Version of Faraday

After many months of work we have reorganized and changed the internal estructure of Faraday turning the whole project into giving it a Package organized structure. This is not something we came up with though, here is a blog with some more information of what this type of structure looks like: https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/ (This is just ilustrative not exactly what we have)


##VirtualEnv
The Firts Step is to create the VirtualEnv.
If you already had a virtual env for faraday, we recomend deleting it and creating a new one.
And if hadn't: We can't stress enough just how important it is to use VirtualEnvs on Pythons projects.
Specially at this time where Python2 is on it's last months of support and so many libraries have already switched to Python3. (Don't worry, before 2020 is here so will we).

### How to create a VirtualEnv
To install VirtualEnv do:
```
pip install virtualenv
```
And to create a new one:
```
virtualenv -p python2 --system-site-packages MYVIRTUALENV
```
And to activate it:
```
source MYVIRTUALENV/bin/activate
```

## Re-Installing faraday 
Delete all .pyc files:
```
find . -name '*.pyc' -exec rm -f '{}' \;
```
If you get an error saying: can't import CONST_LICENSE, it means you the pyc delition didn't work. Try again.

Now we are gonna install all the python dependencies on our new virtual env by doing:

```
python setup.py install
```

If you are on a OSX first install coreutils.


### Faraday Client

If you are using GTK.

now you need to do:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt -U
```

## New aliases

To run the server instead of doing python2 faraday-server.pyc  do:
```
faraday-server 
```
This will work even without being inside the faraday directory (as long as you don't deactivate your virtualenv).

To run the client instead of doing python2 faraday.pyc do:
```
faraday-client
```
To run the manage intead of doing python2 manage.pyc do:
```
faraday-manage
```
