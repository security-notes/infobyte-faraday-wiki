Faraday supports CSV Exporting from its WEB UI.

In order to download a CSV file containing all your findings, go to the Status Report page in our WEB UI by clicking on the second item from the top in our left navigation bar as shown below

and then click on the green download link next to the workspace

Keep in mind that if you filter findings or hide columns in the Status Report, those changes will impact the output of the CSV Export.

For example, if we use the search box to filter out vulnerabilities and leave only a few columns the resulting CSV will contain the same information as the list, as you can see in the images below.
