This is feature that allows you to send data from Faraday to JIRA. In order to do it, go to our [Status Report](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/Status-report), select the desired vulnerabilities and then click on the **JIRA** button. Keep in mind that only confirmed vulnerabilities can be sent.

Once the JIRA dialog opens, fill in all fields and click **OK** (you should use your JIRA's Username and Password).

After the vulnerability has been sent to JIRA, add the column _issuetracker_ so you can see a link that will lead you to this same issue but in JIRA.
