#Only in QT3 UI
Using our plugin you can do different actions in the command line of QT3 , for example

```
$ cd $faraday/bin/
$ #Adding new hosts 
$./fplugin -e 'for h in api.createAndAddHost("8.8.8.8","Linux")'
$ #Get all ip of HostTree
$ ./fplugin -e 'for h in api.__model_controller.getAllHosts(): print h.name' > allhost.txt
$ nmap -i allhost.txt
```

Faraday comes with some presets for bulk actions such as object removal, etc. These are usually necessary when managing large Workspaces. The current presets are:

* delAllHost.py
* delAllServiceClosed.py
* getAllCreds.py
* getAllHosts.py
* getAllIpsInterfaces.py
* getAllIps.py
* getAllOs.py
* getAllTelnet.py
* getAllVnc.py
* getAllVulnsCSV.py
* getAllWebservers.py
* getAllbySrv.py
* delAllVulnsWith.py
* getAllIpsNotServices.py
* getSeverityByCwe.py
* getExploits.py 

For example, getting all IPs in Host Tree to run nmap becomes a simple task:

```
$ cd ~/.faraday/bin/
$ ./fplugin -f getAllIps.py > allhost.txt
$ nmap -i allhost.txt
```

Many of these scripts have names that explain himself what they do, but some of these need some explanation.

#getSeverityByCwe.py

2ยบ : Url to Couchdb

3ยบ : Workspace name
