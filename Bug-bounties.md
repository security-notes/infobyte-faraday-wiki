A bug bounty program is a deal offered by many websites and software developers by which individuals can receive recognition and compensation for reporting bugs, especially those pertaining to exploits and vulnerabilities.

We want Faraday to be an ally for researchers participating in such programs, so we thought it would be interesting to prepare some Workspaces for Bug bounties from different organizations.

Currently we support the following  sites:
* Airbnb
* Facebook
* 
* 
*
