It is possible to check the status of an issue - this could be opened, closed, re-opened or the risk is accepted.

If you set a vulnerability status as closed and later on when you re-scan the target the same issue is found again, the status will automatically change into re-opened allowing you to have a more granular view of the results of your scans. This is perfect for doing remediation retests, helping you to quickly understand what is still vulnerable. 

Also, issues created by a specific tool, can now be filtered and sorted out. A great way to see where are the sources of information used during an engagement.

For example, as we can see in the following screenshots, we have three different issues that are closed [1]. After we import a Nessus scan the issues are marked as re-opened [2], indicating that the vulnerability is still present in the last scan.
