After 3 years of development, we are releasing Faraday, a Multiuser Penetration Test IDE, Designed for collaborative data sharing, indexation and analysis of the generated knowledge during the engagement of a penetration test without changing the way you work. The main purpose of Faraday is to reuse the tools available in the community to get more advantage from them, in a multiuser way.

We are incorporating *"Faraday Awards"* a benefit to open source developers of security tools which Faraday has fed for its functionality. 

We have build a plugin system, where all the I/O from the terminal gets interpreted. If we have a plugin for the command, the output is processed and added to the knowledge base in a transparent way.

We will be releasing an Open Source version, but we are also developing a commercial version with professional features, such as *reporting* and *advanced filters* and *visualizations*.

The idea of the developer awards is that *every buyer* of a Faraday Professional & Enterprise license must necessarily select a beneficiary from a list of supported open source tools. We think this kind of support will help on the continuity of great open source security projects.
