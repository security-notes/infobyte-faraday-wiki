The Faraday Awards was made with the idea to put our money where our mouth is and support open-source tools with some financial benefits for the excellent work they do.

We think this kind of support will help with the continuity of great open source-security projects. With the purchase of every Faraday license, one of the tools below will receive a small payment to help with their future success.

At the moment these are the projects who already have agreed to be part of the awards:
