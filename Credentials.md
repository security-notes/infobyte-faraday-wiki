One of the big goals in every internal pentest is gathering service credentials to log in to a host, escalate privileges and pivot. Save all the found data in Faraday's  and see it in our Credentials View!

## How to add a new credential
In the hosts view you have a special column that says credentials and has a number with the amount of credentials you have already created. Click on that number.
