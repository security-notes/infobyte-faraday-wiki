### Where does the name come from?
The name was picked to honour *Michael Faraday*, an English scientist whose main discoveries include electromagnetism induction, diamagnetism and electrolysis[1]. Mainly his six principles of scientific discipline, acquired at a young age from Isaac Watts' "The Improvement of the mind"[2]:

* Always carry a small pad to take notes at any time
* Maintain abundant correspondence
* Collaborate regularly with others to exchange ideas
* Avoid controversy
* Verify everything that was said to him
* Do not generalize, speak and write as precisely as possible
