This is an experimental new feature that allows you to send data from Faraday to JIRA. Keep in mind that in order to do this, [Faraday Proxy Server must be running](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/Usage#faraday-server).

Go to our [Status Report](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/Usage#vulnerability-status-report), select the desired vulnerabilities and then click on the **JIRA** button. Keep in mind that only confirmed vulnerabilities can be sent.

Once the JIRA dialog opens, fill in all fields and click **OK**.

After the vuln has been sent to JIRA the list will be updated with a link to the new ticket.
