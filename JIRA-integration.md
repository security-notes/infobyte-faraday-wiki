This feature allows you to send data from Faraday to JIRA. In order to do it, go to our [Status Report](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/Usage#vulnerability-status-report), select the desired vulnerabilities and then click on the **JIRA** button. Keep in mind that only confirmed vulnerabilities can be sent.
