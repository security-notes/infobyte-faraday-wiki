Now, you can enrich Vuln data by leaving Comments and Notes, while mentioning other users to notify them about important events in real time. Also, you are now able to configure alerts to follow up on each project, having a more efficient view of their status and updates.

The idea behind this is promoting better ways to get involved with your co-workers by improving communication and daily results.
