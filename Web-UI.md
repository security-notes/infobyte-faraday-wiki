**Workspace Worth**

This visualization is specially helpful when contributing in a bug bounty program. You can estimate how much your Workspace is worth according to the severity of your vulnerabilities.

You can edit the price per severity by clicking on it. The graphic will change as you type.

So lets say that you have a workspace with 6 vulns, one for each severity. And the price schema is:

* Criticals are worth 6 dollars
* Highs are worth 5 dollars
* Meds are worth 4 dollars
* Lows are worth 3 dollars
* Infos are worth 2 dollars
* Unclassifieds are worth 1 dollar

Then your Workspace will be worth 
```
6*1+5*1+4*1+3*1+2*1+1*1 = $21
```

The length of the colored bars shows how much that severity represents in the final worth according to how many of those are present in the current workspace.
