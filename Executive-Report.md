# Intro

The Executive Reports lets you create (as the name implies) reports using the results obtained in each workspace. 
When an Executive Report is created, all the data from the Status Report is automatically processed and placed in a Word compatible document that can then be downloaded.

# Requirements

To utilize this feature follow the necessary steps on [Start up Configuration](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/Start-up-Configuration-%28Faraday-Server%29).

# Managing Executive Reports 

To manage your reports you need to access Faraday's Web Interface and click on the icon **executive reports** ![]

All the reports will be listed, including their info and status.

Once a report has been generated it can't be edited.

# Making a report

To create a new report, navigate to the Executive Report component and click on **New**
![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/infobyte/faraday/images/faraday_report_new_button.png). A new form will open, asking for the following fields:

* Title
* Scope
* Objectives
* Summary
* Conclusions
* Recommendations

Faraday processes all the information and spits out a shiny new report that is available for download from the same list.

If some of the findings in the workspace have tags, you can create a report using only them. When the form opens an option to select tags will appear.

One or more tags can be selected.
