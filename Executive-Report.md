# Intro

The Executive Reports lets you create (as the name implies) reports about the results obtained in each workspace. To make an Executive Report, it takes all the information from the Status Report and automatically creates a word document with all the information for the given project.

# Requirements

To utilize this feature, during the [Start up Configuration](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/Start-up-Configuration-%28Faraday-Server%29) follow the necessary steps when you are configuring the application.

# Making a report

The reports can be seen from a list. On the list we create or eliminate documents.

If you want to create a new report, it's necessary to complete the following information in the form:

* Title
* Scope
* Objectives
* Summary
* Conclusions
* Recommendations

Faraday processes all the information and spits out a shiny new report that is available for download
