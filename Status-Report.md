# Vulnerabilities

To view a full list of findings you can access the Status Report.

The Status Report provides several options including vulnerability search, filtering and management.

Personalize this view by clicking on the blue buttons to select the columns you wish to see, and remove the ones you don't need with the X's in the table. These changes will be persisted in your browser from session to session, so you only have to apply them once.

## _Vulnerability Creation_
To create vulnerabilities manually, you can go to the status report page and click the "New" button at the top right corner. You should see a dialog similar to this:

Make sure you select a host (and a service if the vulnerability applies to it), and the correct type. If you create a web vulnerability, you will have a couple more fields available, such as path, method, request, response and so on.
