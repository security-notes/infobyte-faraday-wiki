Faraday actually consists of two tools: **Faraday Client** and **Faraday Server**. These can run on the same host or not, depending on your needs. Also, to persist all your data Faraday uses [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/).

The recommended approach for first time users is performing a **single Faraday installation in Ubuntu Linux**, as this is the most thoroughly tested distribution. This means using the same machine for both the client and the server.

The installation is divided between the [server](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/installation-server) and [client](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/installation-client). It is recommended to first follow the necessary steps to install the server, and test that it is working correctly.

Once you have the server running, you are free to install the client if you need it.

If you wish to use SSL use our [SSL guide](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/SSL).
