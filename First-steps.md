Faraday actually consists of two tools; Faraday Client and Faraday Server. These can run on the same host or not, depending on your needs.

The recommended approach for first time users is performing a single Faraday installation in an Ubuntu Linux. Download the [latest tarball](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/tarball/master), unpack and run:

```
$ ./install.sh
$ ./faraday.py
```
