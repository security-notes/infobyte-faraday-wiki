## Using Faraday Zap Extension

With Faraday Zap Extension, you are able to send new issues directly from OWASP Zap into Faraday. 

The first thing we need to do is to download [Faraday Zap Extension](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/releases/download/v3.3/zap-plugin.zap).

Once we have downloaded it, we need to load it into OWASP Zap. You can load an add-on as the sample image below or by typing [Ctrl + L]:

Now we need to authenticate into the Faraday Zap extension by using our Faraday's credentials. Go into _Tools/Faraday configuration_ options or type [Ctrl+Alt+F]:

Type your credentials and set the Faraday Server URL to the correct one. Then click _Login_:
