This is Faraday's new feature to manage methodologies and tasks.

You can create your custom methodologies, add tasks, tag them and keep track of your whole project directly from Faraday.

Faraday comes with methodologies loaded by default that allows you to get to work quickly without having to create your own, although you can also create your one!

A few of our default methodologies:

* PCI DSS 11.2
* Hardware Top 10
* Mobile Security
* Network Pentest
* Owasp Top 10

### Creating you own methodology:

Create a CSV file with the following fields:

* name
* description

Then,use the "Import" button and select your new CSV to load your custom methodology to Faraday.
