This is Faraday's new feature to manage methodologies and tasks for our Professional and Corporate clients.

You can create your own custom methodologies, add tasks, tag them and keep track of your whole project directly from Faraday.

Faraday comes with methodologies loaded by default that allow you to get to work quickly without having to create your own.

A few of our default methodologies:

* PCI DSS 11.2
* Hardware Top 10
* Mobile Security
* Network Pentest
* Owasp Top 10

## Loading a default methodology:

Use the button "New" and select the option "From template", give this new methodology a name and ready!
